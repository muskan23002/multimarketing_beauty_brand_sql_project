## 🔍 Analyst Notes

> **Dataset Transparency:** This dataset is synthetically generated. Several patterns (identical CPL/CPC across brands, absence of festive season spikes, unrealistically high ROAS) reflect this. All analysis is performed on the data as-is, with anomalies flagged and explained — demonstrating real-world data validation practices.
