## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from Kaggle:
**[Multi-Brand Marketing Campaign Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshriya08/multi-brand-marketing-campaign-performance-dataset)**

### Dataset Details

| Property | Details |
|---|---|
| Brands | Nykaa, Purplle, Tira |
| Rows | 55,555 per brand (1,66,665 total) |
| Time Period | July 2024 — May 2025 |
| Format | CSV (3 separate files, one per brand) |

### Schema

**Step 1 — Individual Brand Tables (3 tables, identical structure)**

> Note: Same schema applies to `purplle_campaigns` and `tira_campaigns`

```sql
CREATE TABLE nykaa_campaigns (
    campaign_id        VARCHAR(20),
    campaign_type      VARCHAR(50),
    target_audience    VARCHAR(100),
    duration           INT,
    channel_used       VARCHAR(50),
    impressions        INT,
    clicks             INT,
    leads              INT,
    conversions        INT,
    revenue            NUMERIC(10,2),
    acquisition_cost   NUMERIC(10,2),

## Business Problems and Solutions

### BQ1 — Which campaign type works best for each customer segment?

**Objective:** Identify the optimal campaign type for each customer segment to guide targeted marketing strategy.

```sql
SELECT
    brand,
    customer_segment,
    campaign_type,
    COUNT(campaign_id)                                                            AS total_campaigns,
    ROUND(SUM(clicks)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(impressions), 0) * 100, 2)           AS ctr_percent,
    ROUND(SUM(conversions)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(clicks), 0) * 100, 2)           AS cvr_percent,
    ROUND(SUM(revenue)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(acquisition_cost), 0), 2)           AS roas,
    ROUND(SUM(revenue) / NULLIF(COUNT(campaign_id), 0), 2)                       AS revenue_per_campaign
FROM all_campaigns
GROUP BY brand, customer_segment, campaign_type
ORDER BY brand, customer_segment, roas DESC;
```

**Finding:** Tira's Youth segment via Paid Ads delivers the highest ROAS of 1486 in the entire dataset. No single campaign type dominates across all segments — confirming the need for segment-specific strategies.

---

### BQ2 — Which channel drives most conversions per brand?

**Objective:** Determine which platform generates the most purchases for each brand to guide channel investment decisions.

```sql
SELECT
    brand,
    TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(channel_used, ',')))                              AS single_channel,
    COUNT(campaign_id)                                                            AS total_campaigns,
    SUM(conversions)                                                              AS total_conversions,
    ROUND(SUM(conversions)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(clicks), 0) * 100, 2)           AS cvr_percent,
    ROUND(SUM(revenue)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(acquisition_cost), 0), 2)           AS roas,
    ROUND(SUM(conversions)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(COUNT(campaign_id), 0), 2)          AS conversions_per_campaign
FROM all_campaigns
GROUP BY brand, single_channel
ORDER BY brand, total_conversions DESC;
```

**Finding:** Google consistently ranks last in conversions for all 3 brands — confirming beauty is a visual discovery category. Instagram leads for Nykaa and Tira while Email leads for Purplle.

---

### BQ3 — Top 5 performing campaigns overall by revenue

**Objective:** Identify star campaigns to study their characteristics and replicate their success.

```sql
SELECT
    brand,
    campaign_id,
    campaign_type,
    channel_used,
    customer_segment,
    campaign_date,
    impressions,
    clicks,
    conversions,
    revenue,
    ROUND(clicks::NUMERIC / NULLIF(impressions, 0) * 100, 2)                     AS ctr_percent,
    ROUND(conversions::NUMERIC / NULLIF(clicks, 0) * 100, 2)                     AS cvr_percent,
    ROUND(revenue::NUMERIC / NULLIF(acquisition_cost, 0), 2)                     AS roas,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY revenue DESC)                                           AS revenue_rank
FROM all_campaigns
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Finding:** Top campaigns achieve CTR of 14-15% and CVR of 40-46% — nearly double the dataset average of 8.5% CTR and 22% CVR. YouTube appears in 4 of 5 top campaigns despite ranking last in total conversions — revealing a high-ticket conversion pattern.

---

### BQ4 — Which brand is most consistent performer across all months?

**Objective:** Measure revenue consistency using standard deviation to identify the most reliable brand.

```sql
SELECT
    brand,
    ROUND(AVG(monthly_revenue), 2)                                                AS avg_monthly_revenue,
    ROUND(MAX(monthly_revenue), 2)                                                AS best_month_revenue,
    ROUND(MIN(monthly_revenue), 2)                                                AS worst_month_revenue,
    ROUND(MAX(monthly_revenue) - MIN(monthly_revenue), 2)                         AS revenue_gap,
    ROUND(STDDEV(monthly_revenue), 2)                                             AS revenue_stddev,
    COUNT(year_month)                                                             AS months_tracked
FROM (
    SELECT
        brand,
        TO_CHAR(campaign_date, 'YYYY-MM')   AS year_month,
        SUM(revenue)                         AS monthly_revenue
    FROM all_campaigns
    WHERE campaign_date < '2025-06-01'
    GROUP BY brand, year_month
) AS monthly_summary
GROUP BY brand
ORDER BY revenue_stddev ASC;
```

**Finding:** Tira is the most consistent brand with the lowest standard deviation (₹6.47 Cr) and smallest revenue gap (₹17.5 Cr) — remarkable stability for a brand launched in 2023. Nykaa generates highest revenue but is most volatile (stddev ₹9.49 Cr).

### BQ5 — Which customer segment + channel combination gives best ROAS?

**Objective:** Find the perfect targeting combination — which customer to target on which platform — for maximum return.

```sql
SELECT
    brand,
    customer_segment,
    TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(channel_used, ',')))                              AS single_channel,
    COUNT(campaign_id)                                                            AS total_campaigns,
    ROUND(SUM(clicks)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(impressions), 0) * 100, 2)           AS ctr_percent,
    ROUND(SUM(conversions)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(clicks), 0) * 100, 2)           AS cvr_percent,
    ROUND(SUM(revenue)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(acquisition_cost), 0), 2)           AS roas,
    ROUND(SUM(revenue) / NULLIF(COUNT(campaign_id), 0), 2)                       AS revenue_per_campaign
FROM all_campaigns
GROUP BY brand, customer_segment, single_channel
ORDER BY brand, roas DESC;
```

**Finding:** Tira's Youth + Instagram delivers the highest ROAS of 1461 across the entire dataset. Facebook consistently underperforms for Youth across all brands — confirming platform demographic shift toward Instagram and WhatsApp.

---

### BQ6 — Month over Month revenue growth — which brand grew fastest?

**Objective:** Track revenue momentum month by month to identify growth trends and slowdowns.

```sql
WITH monthly_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        brand,
        TO_CHAR(campaign_date, 'YYYY-MM')   AS year_month,
        TO_CHAR(campaign_date, 'Mon YYYY')  AS month_name,
        SUM(revenue)                         AS total_revenue
    FROM all_campaigns
    WHERE campaign_date < '2025-06-01'
    GROUP BY brand, year_month, month_name
),
mom_growth AS (
    SELECT
        brand,
        year_month,
        month_name,
        total_revenue,
        LAG(total_revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY brand ORDER BY year_month) AS prev_month_revenue,
        ROUND(
            (total_revenue - LAG(total_revenue) OVER (
                PARTITION BY brand ORDER BY year_month
            ))::NUMERIC / NULLIF(LAG(total_revenue) OVER (
                PARTITION BY brand ORDER BY year_month
            ), 0) * 100
        , 2) AS mom_growth_percent
    FROM monthly_revenue
)
SELECT * FROM mom_growth
ORDER BY brand, year_month ASC;
```

**Finding:** February is a universal dip month across all brands (structural 28-day effect). March delivers the strongest recovery — Nykaa at +10.18%, Purplle at +9.38%. Purplle recorded the single largest MoM decline of -9.74% in February 2025.

---

### BQ7 — CTR vs CVR vs ROAS conflict matrix

**Objective:** Categorize each campaign type into performance buckets to identify awareness vs conversion campaigns.

```sql
WITH ctr_cvr_analysis AS (
    SELECT
        brand,
        campaign_type,
        COUNT(campaign_id)                                                        AS total_campaigns,
        ROUND(SUM(clicks)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(impressions), 0) * 100, 2)       AS ctr_percent,
        ROUND(SUM(conversions)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(clicks), 0) * 100, 2)       AS cvr_percent,
        ROUND(SUM(revenue)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(acquisition_cost), 0), 2)       AS roas
    FROM all_campaigns
    GROUP BY brand, campaign_type
),
avg_values AS (
    SELECT
        ROUND(AVG(ctr_percent), 2) AS avg_ctr,
        ROUND(AVG(cvr_percent), 2) AS avg_cvr,
        ROUND(AVG(roas), 2)        AS avg_roas
    FROM ctr_cvr_analysis
)
SELECT
    c.brand, c.campaign_type, c.total_campaigns,
    c.ctr_percent, c.cvr_percent, c.roas,
    a.avg_ctr, a.avg_cvr, a.avg_roas,
    CASE
        WHEN c.ctr_percent >= a.avg_ctr AND c.cvr_percent >= a.avg_cvr
            THEN 'Star - High CTR + High CVR'
        WHEN c.ctr_percent >= a.avg_ctr AND c.cvr_percent < a.avg_cvr AND c.roas > a.avg_roas
            THEN 'Hidden Gem - High CTR + Low CVR + High ROAS'
        WHEN c.ctr_percent >= a.avg_ctr AND c.cvr_percent < a.avg_cvr
            THEN 'Awareness - High CTR + Low CVR'
        WHEN c.ctr_percent < a.avg_ctr AND c.cvr_percent >= a.avg_cvr
            THEN 'Converter - Low CTR + High CVR'
        WHEN c.ctr_percent < a.avg_ctr AND c.cvr_percent < a.avg_cvr AND c.roas > a.avg_roas
            THEN 'Sleeper - Low CTR + Low CVR + High ROAS'
        ELSE 'Underperformer - Low CTR + Low CVR'
    END AS campaign_category
FROM ctr_cvr_analysis c
CROSS JOIN avg_values a
ORDER BY c.brand, c.roas DESC;
```

**Finding:** Paid Ads performs differently for each brand — Star for Tira, Converter for Purplle, Awareness for Nykaa — demonstrating that channel effectiveness depends on brand execution quality. Social Media is the most consistently strong campaign type, never falling below Hidden Gem status.

---

### BQ8 — Which language performs best across all brands?

**Objective:** Identify which language campaign generates the highest ROAS to guide regional marketing investment.

```sql
SELECT
    brand,
    language,
    COUNT(campaign_id)                                                            AS total_campaigns,
    SUM(impressions)                                                              AS total_impressions,
    SUM(conversions)                                                              AS total_conversions,
    ROUND(SUM(clicks)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(impressions), 0) * 100, 2)           AS ctr_percent,
    ROUND(SUM(conversions)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(clicks), 0) * 100, 2)           AS cvr_percent,
    ROUND(SUM(revenue)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(acquisition_cost), 0), 2)           AS roas,
    ROUND(SUM(revenue) / NULLIF(COUNT(campaign_id), 0), 2)                       AS revenue_per_campaign
FROM all_campaigns
GROUP BY brand, language
ORDER BY brand, roas DESC;
```

**Finding:** Tamil is Tira's strongest language with ROAS of 1391 — suggesting strong South India market penetration. English leads for Nykaa and Purplle but ranks last for Tira — confirming brand-specific regional audience differences.

---

### BQ9 — Which campaign duration drives best performance?

**Objective:** Determine the optimal campaign length for each brand to maximize ROAS and revenue per campaign.

```sql
SELECT
    brand,
    CASE
        WHEN duration BETWEEN 5  AND 10 THEN '1. Short (5-10 days)'
        WHEN duration BETWEEN 11 AND 17 THEN '2. Medium (11-17 days)'
        WHEN duration BETWEEN 18 AND 24 THEN '3. Long (18-24 days)'
        WHEN duration BETWEEN 25 AND 30 THEN '4. Extra Long (25-30 days)'
    END                                                                           AS duration_bucket,
    COUNT(campaign_id)                                                            AS total_campaigns,
    ROUND(AVG(duration), 1)                                                       AS avg_duration_days,
    ROUND(SUM(clicks)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(impressions), 0) * 100, 2)           AS ctr_percent,
    ROUND(SUM(conversions)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(clicks), 0) * 100, 2)           AS cvr_percent,
    ROUND(SUM(revenue)::NUMERIC / NULLIF(SUM(acquisition_cost), 0), 2)           AS roas,
    ROUND(SUM(revenue) / NULLIF(COUNT(campaign_id), 0), 2)                       AS revenue_per_campaign,
    ROUND(AVG(engagement_score), 2)                                               AS avg_engagement_score
FROM all_campaigns
GROUP BY brand, duration_bucket
ORDER BY brand, duration_bucket ASC;
```

**Finding:** Extra Long campaigns (25-30 days) deliver highest ROAS for Nykaa and Tira. Purplle peaks with Long campaigns (18-24 days). Tira's Short campaigns generate the highest revenue per campaign — indicating extremely high-quality brief targeted campaigns.

---

### BQ10 — Which brand recovers fastest after a low revenue month?

**Objective:** Measure brand resilience by tracking how quickly each brand bounces back from a revenue dip.

```sql
WITH monthly_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        brand,
        TO_CHAR(campaign_date, 'YYYY-MM')   AS year_month,
        TO_CHAR(campaign_date, 'Mon YYYY')  AS month_name,
        SUM(revenue)                         AS total_revenue
    FROM all_campaigns
    WHERE campaign_date < '2025-06-01'
    GROUP BY brand, year_month, month_name
),
with_lag AS (
    SELECT
        brand, year_month, month_name, total_revenue,
        LAG(total_revenue)  OVER (PARTITION BY brand ORDER BY year_month) AS prev_revenue,
        LEAD(total_revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY brand ORDER BY year_month) AS next_revenue
    FROM monthly_revenue
),
recovery_analysis AS (
    SELECT
        brand, year_month, month_name, total_revenue, prev_revenue, next_revenue,
        CASE
            WHEN total_revenue < prev_revenue AND next_revenue > total_revenue
                THEN 'Recovered Next Month'
            WHEN total_revenue < prev_revenue AND next_revenue <= total_revenue
                THEN 'Stayed Down'
            WHEN total_revenue >= prev_revenue
                THEN 'No Drop'
        END AS recovery_status
    FROM with_lag
    WHERE prev_revenue IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT * FROM recovery_analysis
ORDER BY brand, year_month ASC;
```

**Finding:** Purplle and Tira both achieve an 80% monthly recovery rate vs Nykaa's 67%. Tira uniquely avoided consecutive declining months entirely — the most resilient brand. All 3 brands recovered from February's structural dip in March.

---

## Findings and Conclusions

### 1. Brand Performance Overview
All three brands — Nykaa, Purplle, and Tira — operate at comparable efficiency levels with average CTR of ~8.5% and CVR of ~22% across 1,66,665 campaigns over 11 months. However, significant strategic differences emerge when performance is broken down by channel, segment, and campaign type.

### 2. Brand Consistency — Tira Leads Surprisingly
Tira, despite being the newest brand (launched 2023), emerges as the most operationally consistent performer with the lowest revenue standard deviation of ₹6.47 Cr and a revenue gap of just ₹17.5 Cr between its best and worst months. Nykaa generates the highest average monthly revenue at ₹252 Cr but shows the greatest volatility — standard deviation of ₹9.49 Cr — reflecting an aggressive campaign-driven strategy. Purplle recorded the single largest month-over-month decline of -9.74% in February 2025, indicating higher seasonal dependency. Tira and Purplle both achieved an 80% monthly recovery rate vs Nykaa's 67% — confirming Tira as the most resilient brand.

### 3. Channel Strategy — No Universal Winner
Email consistently delivers the highest ROAS for Nykaa (1389) and Purplle (1382), reflecting strong retention marketing through engaged subscriber bases. Instagram leads for Tira (1397) — aligning with its visual-first brand identity and younger audience. Google ranks last in conversions across all three brands, confirming that beauty is a visual discovery category where intent-based search ads underperform. WhatsApp remains an underutilised mid-tier channel that consistently outperforms Google despite lower investment — a significant untapped opportunity for all three brands in the Indian market.

### 4. Campaign Type Performance
Paid Ads delivers the highest ROAS for Purplle (1397) and Tira (1418) while Social Media leads for Nykaa (1386). The CTR-CVR-ROAS conflict matrix reveals a striking finding — Paid Ads is classified as a Star for Tira, Converter for Purplle, and Awareness for Nykaa — the same campaign type performing entirely differently across brands. This confirms that channel effectiveness depends on brand execution quality, not the channel itself. Influencer campaigns show the highest variance — performing as Star for Nykaa but Underperformer for Tira — highlighting the critical importance of brand-influencer fit.

### 5. Customer Segment Insights
Youth emerges as the highest-value segment for Tira — the combination of Youth + Instagram delivers the highest ROAS of 1461 in the entire dataset. Working Women are Nykaa's most valuable segment (ROAS 1383), while College Students drive Purplle's strongest returns (ROAS 1391). Across all three brands, Premium Shoppers consistently underperform in ROAS despite higher spending — indicating disproportionately high acquisition costs that are not justified by revenue returns.

### 6. Language and Regional Performance
Tamil is Tira's strongest language with ROAS of 1391 — the highest in the entire language analysis — suggesting strong regional traction in South India, potentially driven by Tata's brand trust in that market. English leads for Nykaa and Purplle but ranks last for Tira, confirming that language effectiveness is entirely brand-specific. Hindi consistently performs mid-tier across all brands — reflecting high competition in India's largest language market.

### 7. Time and Seasonal Trends
February is a universal structural dip month across all three brands — driven by the shorter 28-day month rather than campaign failure. March consistently delivers the strongest recovery — Nykaa at +10.18% and Purplle at +9.38%. Q2 FY (Oct-Dec) drives the highest absolute revenue across all brands, consistent with India's festive season spending behaviour. Q3 FY (Jan-Mar) delivers the highest ROAS for Purplle and Tira — a post-festive efficiency window where reduced competitive pressure lowers acquisition costs while purchase intent remains strong.

### 8. Top Campaign Characteristics
The top 5 revenue-generating campaigns share common traits — CTR of 14-15% and CVR of 40-46%, nearly double the dataset averages. YouTube appears in 4 of 5 top campaigns despite ranking last in total conversions, revealing a high-ticket conversion pattern where YouTube drives fewer but significantly higher-value purchases. Two of the top 5 campaigns ran in October 2024 — confirming festive timing as a revenue amplifier.

> **Dataset Transparency Note:** This dataset is synthetically generated. Patterns such as identical CPL/CPC across brands and absence of festive season spikes reflect this. All anomalies were identified, flagged, and explained throughout the analysis — demonstrating real-world data validation and sanity-checking practices.

## Recommendations

### For Nykaa
1. **Reduce Google ad spend** — Google ranks last in conversions and CVR for Nykaa. Reallocating this budget to Instagram or Email would generate stronger returns.
2. **Leverage Email for retention** — Email delivers Nykaa's highest ROAS (1389) and CVR (22.12%). Investing in personalised email campaigns for existing customers is the highest-efficiency strategy.
3. **Double down on Working Women segment** — Working Women deliver Nykaa's highest ROAS (1383) and CTR. Social Media campaigns targeting this segment during lunch-break hours would maximise engagement.
4. **Investigate September dip** — Nykaa shows a significant -7.98% revenue drop in September 2024 with no clear seasonal explanation. A deeper investigation into campaign quality and budget allocation during this period is recommended.
5. **Plan aggressively for March** — Nykaa's strongest MoM recovery is +10.18% in March. Front-loading March budgets would capitalise on this structural rebound window.

### For Purplle
1. **Fix Bengali campaigns urgently** — Bengali is Purplle's worst-performing language (ROAS 1335) despite being a large and engaged market. Localised content and regional influencer partnerships should be prioritised.
2. **Scale Email channel** — Email is Purplle's top channel by both conversions and ROAS (1382). Expanding the email subscriber base through sign-up incentives would directly impact revenue.
3. **Reconsider Influencer strategy** — Influencer campaigns are Purplle's weakest campaign type (ROAS 1313). Either the influencer partnerships need to be renegotiated or the budget should be shifted to Paid Ads and Email.
4. **Build Q3 FY strategy** — Purplle achieves its highest ROAS in Q3 (Jan-Mar) at 1393. A dedicated post-festive retention campaign running January through March would maximise this efficiency window.
5. **Address February vulnerability** — Purplle recorded the highest single-month decline of -9.74% in February. Pre-loading campaigns in late January to bridge the gap would reduce this structural dip.

### For Tira
1. **Invest heavily in Youth + Instagram** — This combination delivers the highest ROAS of 1461 in the entire dataset. Tira's highest growth opportunity lies in scaling this specific targeting combination aggressively.
2. **Expand Tamil language campaigns** — Tamil delivers Tira's highest ROAS (1391) and is the strongest language in the entire analysis. Deeper investment in South Indian markets through Tamil content, influencers, and regional platforms would unlock significant growth.
3. **Rebuild Influencer strategy** — Influencer campaigns are Tira's worst performer (ROAS 1345, Underperformer category). A complete audit of current influencer partnerships and pivot toward data-driven influencer selection is recommended.
4. **Leverage brand consistency as an asset** — Tira's low revenue standard deviation and 80% recovery rate show exceptional operational stability. This should be communicated as a brand strength in investor and stakeholder reporting.
5. **Scale Short campaigns** — Tira's Short (5-10 day) campaigns deliver the highest revenue per campaign (₹5,13,271). Running more frequent, brief, highly-targeted campaigns rather than long-duration broad campaigns would maximise efficiency.

## Conclusion

When I started this project, I expected the usual story — Nykaa dominates, bigger brand wins, Google Ads rule everything. The data had other plans.

Tira, the youngest of the three brands, turned out to be the most consistent and resilient. Google, the world's biggest ad platform, ranked dead last for all three brands. Premium Shoppers — the segment every marketer chases — delivered the weakest returns. And the Youth + Instagram combination for Tira quietly delivered the highest ROAS in the entire dataset.

That's what makes data analysis exciting — not confirming what you already think, but discovering what you didn't expect.

This project covers 1,66,665 campaigns across 11 months and answers 10 real business questions using PostgreSQL — from basic GROUP BY aggregations all the way to window functions, CTEs, UNNEST for multi-channel parsing, and a CROSS JOIN conflict matrix. Every query was written with a business question in mind, not just to show SQL skills.

The Power BI dashboard is coming next — because insights locked in a SQL query aren't useful until a decision-maker can actually see and interact with them.

If you're a recruiter, hiring manager, or fellow data enthusiast — I'd love to connect and hear your thoughts! 🚀
